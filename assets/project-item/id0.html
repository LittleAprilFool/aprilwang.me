<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>1. How do conversational programmers perceive the effectiveness of different programming learning resources? </p>
<p>2. To what extent does learning programming  help conversational programmers’ on-the-job? </p>
<p>3. What are conversational programmers’ attitudes towards learning programming? </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The overall goal of our research is to shed light on the learning needs and strategies of conversational programmers and how they differ from artifact-creation needs of end-user programmers and professional developers. </p>
<p><em>Conversational programmers</em> are people who do not have formal training in computer science and are working in non-engineering roles but try to learn programming to engage more effectively in technical conversations or to improve their job marketability [1]. Their goal is not necessarily to create artifacts or solve computational problems, but to use programming literacy as a mechanism for establishing common ground in technical conversations. </p>

<h2>My Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed prior works on non-traditional learner populations and how people interact with formal and informal programming learning resources</li>
  <li>Conducted interviews with 23 conversational programmers to investigate their learning strategies</li>
  <li>Collected, coded, and analyzed data using ATLAS.ti</li>
  <li>Used an inductive analysis approach and affinity diagrams to explore the themes</li>
</ul>
