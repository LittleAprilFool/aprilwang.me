            ## Undergraduate and Master Students at ETH Zürich 
            I'm thrilled to collaborate with undergraduates and master students at ETH Zürich who have an interest in the type of research I conduct. Many of the students I've worked with have gone on to co-author papers with me, and a significant number are now enrolled in prestigious graduate schools or working in leading industries. There's often an opportunity for students who have experience or interest in areas like software development, data science, or UX research to join in on projects.
