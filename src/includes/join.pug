            ## Visiting Students Outside of ETH Zürich
            Due to the limited capacity, we prioritize students at ETH Zürich to join existing projects, as these opportunities are often integrated into their master's or bachelor's thesis work.
            Nonetheless, we welcome visiting students who show exceptional self-motivation and have secured external fellowships (e.g., [ETH SSRF](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/summer-research-fellowship.html), [ETH Project Mobility](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/non-degree-courses/project.html)) for their visit.
