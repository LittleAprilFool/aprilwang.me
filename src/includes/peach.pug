        At the Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction Lab (PEACH), our mission is to create expressive, intelligent, and human-centered systems that make technical topicsâ€”like programming, data, and AIâ€”more accessible and engaging. We research novel interface designs to enhance communication and collaboration in abstract and logical reasoning, allowing learners to better understand and apply computational competencies in real-world contexts. We are interested in a variety of topics:
        
        - **Textual Representation for Programming**: We explore ways to make programming workflows more explainable and collaborative by tightly integrating documentation, discussion, and code. Our goal is to help teams work more effectively and reduce misinterpretations.
        
        - **Visual Representation for Programming**: Visual tools are essential for explaining complex programming ideas. We design interactive tutorial platforms that encourage hands-on and project-based learning for deeper understanding.
    
        - **Embodied Representation for Programming**: Moving beyond traditional interfaces, we explore metaphors, social simulators, physical objects, and augmented reality to make computational and AI literacy more tangible and engaging.
    
        - **Supporting Diverse User Needs**: We examine learning and knowledge sharing through a cognitive lens and explore the impact of social factors particularly in a CS classroom. Our research informs the design of adaptive tools that accommodate diverse user needs.

        - **Balancing Automation with Agency**: We develop intelligent systems that facilitate communication of technical topics while ensuring users retain control. These systems are designed to enhance, rather than replace, human expertise, enabling users to make informed decisions.
