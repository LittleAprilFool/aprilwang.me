        At the Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction Lab (PEACH), our mission is to create expressive, intelligent, and human-centered systems that make technical topicsâ€”like programming, data, and AIâ€”more accessible and engaging. We research novel interface designs to effectively communicate abstract concepts and logical reasoning processes, allowing learners to better understand and apply these ideas in real-world contexts. We are interested in a variety of topics:

        - **Natural Language for Programming**: We explore ways to make programming workflows more intuitive and collaborative by tightly integrating documentation, discussion, and code. Our goal is to simplify communication in data science and beyond, helping teams work more efficiently and avoid misunderstandings.

        - **Visual Language for Programming**: Visual tools are essential for explaining complex programming ideas. We design interactive tutorial platforms that let learners experiment in real time, encouraging hands-on learning and deeper understanding. For professionals, such visual and interactive explanations allow them to better understand code for productivity -- whether it is created by past themselves, collaborators, or AI.

        - **Embodied Language for Programming**: We go beyond traditional interfaces by connecting abstract programming concepts to tangible, relatable experiences. This includes using metaphors, physical objects, and augmented reality to make programming and data more engaging.

        - **Supporting Diverse User Needs**: We use empirical methods to explore how factors such as task type, learning goals, team size, and collaboration style influence programming experiences and study the design of tools and representations that adapt to users' diverse needs.

        - **Balancing Automation with Agency**: We are interested in building intelligent systems to help people communicate technical topics. And such systems should augment the target users instead of replacing them, ensuring that the users can understand and direct systems' behaviors to make informed decisions.
