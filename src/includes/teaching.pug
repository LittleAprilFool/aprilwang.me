            ### Available Thesis Projects
            We welcome undergraduates and master students at ETH ZÃ¼rich to conduct their [thesis or semester projects](https://inf.ethz.ch/studies/semester-and-master-theses.html) in the lab. 
            There's often an opportunity for students who have experience or interest in areas like software development, data science, or UX design to join in on projects.
            If you have taken the user-centered programming interfaces course, or the design in educational technology, we welcome you to propose your own project topics.
