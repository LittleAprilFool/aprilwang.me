    "about": "I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href='https://inf.ethz.ch/'>Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href='https://ethz.ch'>ETH Zürich</a>, directing the Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction Lab (PEACH Lab). I am a core faculty member at the <a href='https://iis.inf.ethz.ch/'>Institute for Intelligent Interactive Systems</a>, and associated with the <a href='https://ai.ethz.ch/''>ETH AI Center</a>. I am also a member of <a href='https://hci.ethz.ch/'>ETH HCI</a>, and <a href='https://swisschi.acm.org/groups/'>Swiss CHI</a>. I received my PhD from <a href='https://www.si.umich.edu/'>School of Information</a> at <a href='https://umich.edu/'>University of Michigan</a>, advised by professors <a href='https://from.so/'>Steve Oney</a> and <a href='https://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/'>Christopher Brooks</a>. My main area of research is in human-computer interaction (HCI) and educational technology. My work seeks to help people communicate about programming more effectively by redesigning literate programming environments both in professional and educational contexts.",
    "bio": "Programming is a social activity that heavily relies on collaboration and communication. Can programming be more than just a set of instructions for machines? What if we viewed programming as a form of literature, written not only to communicate with computers but also with people? This shift in perspective -- from programming as machine-oriented to human-centered -- has the potential to fundamentally transform how we design, write, teach, and understand code. By rethinking in the space of literate programming, my work explores ways to make programming more natural and intuitive to communicate beyond tools like {IDEs, computational notebooks, documentation, tutorials} that we have today. To do so, my work investigates creative ways to represent code, including {text, shapes, animations, interactive explorables, editing histories, everyday objects, metaphors, and more}. For more about this vision, check out my <a href='https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/lecture/82526477-003a-4ffb-9e82-154616e9ef34.html'>inaugural lecture</a>."

My research draws upon human-centered design techniques to explore challenges in shared sense-making in data scientists’ collaboration practices and reimagine programming interfaces to support collaboration. I conducted in-depth qualitative inquiries to understand how data scientists currently use computational notebooks for collaboration. I developed computational tools to facilitate shared sense-making in computational notebooks. <br><br> I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from <strong>Zhejiang University</strong> and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong>, where my master thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.
