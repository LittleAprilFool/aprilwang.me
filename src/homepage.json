My research draws upon human-centered design techniques to explore challenges in shared sense-making in data scientistsâ€™ collaboration practices and reimagine programming interfaces to support collaboration. I conducted in-depth qualitative inquiries to understand how data scientists currently use computational notebooks for collaboration. I developed computational tools to facilitate shared sense-making in computational notebooks. <br><br> I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from <strong>Zhejiang University</strong> and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong>, where my master thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.
