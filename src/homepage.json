My broad research area is <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong>, with a focus on <strong>enabling and encouraging collaborations for end-user programming</strong>. My recent project involves improving computational notebook infrastructure (e.g., support real-time group collaboration, facilitate joint discourse over shared context) to better support collaborative data science. <br><br> I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science from <strong>Zhejiang University</strong> and M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong>, where my master thesis investigated non-programmers learning computational literacy.
