I am a <strong>thesis-based MSc student</strong> in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the School of Computing Science, <strong>Simon Fraser University</strong>, advised by <a href='http://hci.cs.sfu.ca/'>Dr.Chilana</a>. My research interests focus on <strong>using HCI techniques to lower the learning barriers for people without professional knowledge in a particular subject</strong>. <br><br> Before starting my journey in HCI research, I finished my Bachelor's degree in College of Computer Science and Technology, <strong>Zhejiang Univerisity</strong>, China. With a major in <strong>Digital Media and Network Technology</strong>, I received interdisciplinary training in multimedia processing, game engineering and human interface design. In addition, I have previously worked in <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>Alibaba</strong> as a <strong>User Experience Design Intern</strong>, and <strong>NetEase Games</strong> as a <strong>Junior Software Developer</strong>."
